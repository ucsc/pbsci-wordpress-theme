        <p>Though still a relatively young campus, UC Santa Cruz has earned national and international recognition for quality research and world-class teaching. Our faculty, researchers, and students enjoy an exciting environment and the opportunity to
            work across disciplinary boundaries as they approach today's most challenging problems in human health, the environment, and advanced technology. And studies show that UCSC's programs in the physical and biological sciences have unusually
            high impact, as measured by citation counts.</p>
        <p>A full complement of graduate programs is enriched by access to state-of-the-art lab facilities and equipment and a variety of field study environments, enhanced by facilities in the Monterey Bay region and backed by the resources and benefits
            of the statewide UC system. Our highly collaborative programs prepare leaders in academia, research, government, and industry.</p>
        <p>Many aspects of our undergraduate programs set UC Santa Cruz apart from most other major research universities, including research and internship opportunities, intensive field studies, and senior capstone activities. We attract a particularly
            innovative and engaged group of students, and we host many opportunities to acknowledge and celebrate their successes.</p>
        <p>We invite you to discover the physical and biological sciences at UC Santa Cruz. Explore this web site. Visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> or the historic <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/index.html">Lick Observatory</a>.
            Attend a public lecture given by a world-class UCSC scientist. And please consider supporting the Division's education, research, and outreach activities with a <a href="../support-us/index.html" title="Development Office">financial gift</a>.
            Your partnership helps us ensure continued excellence.</p>
